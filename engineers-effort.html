 The speed and scale of diagnostic tests for COVID-19 have improved 
greatly, and engineers have brought artificial intelligence, automation,
 and process control to industry’s development of those diagnostics. The
 increase in testing capability is due in great measure to these 
engineering tools. One important element engineering brings is risk 
modeling. For example, suppose you’re relying on a certain precursor 
chemical to make a therapeutic, and there’s a hurricane between you and 
the source. Do you have a secondary source? Or what happens if you’re 
making drugs or vaccines, and there’s a three-day moratorium on 
shipping, or an airport is closed? You have to be able to adjust.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 28px;">To
 help do this, some companies are using what’s called a “digital twin” —
 a computer model of the real world that can help them adjust to the 
real world. They model systems in the real world — such as the pandemic,
 or manufacturing processes — which lets them anticipate problems and 
plan what to do. &nbsp;The model is continually improved by putting in more 
real-world data as it emerges.</span></p><p><br></p></div>
